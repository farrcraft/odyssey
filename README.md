# The Untitled Adventure / Odyssey

This is a hobby game engine (and game) written in modern C++.  It is purpose-built and not intended to be a generic framework for all game types.
Nor is it intended to be production-ready by any means (I'm not blessing the main branch, I might not get around to tests or CI, etc...).
